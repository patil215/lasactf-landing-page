				<h2>What is a CTF?</h2>
				<p>A CTF, or "Capture the Flag" competition, is a type of computer security contest. Strings of text, referred to as "flags," are hidden or encrypted in a series of challenges.
					During the competition, participants try to decrypt, hack, reverse-engineer, or exploit the challenges in order to gain access to the flag.
					For each flag retrieved, the team gets a certain number of points, and teams with the most points win.</p>

				<h2>How will LASACTF be run?</h2>
				<p>LASACTF will consist of several dozen problems that gradually increase in difficulty (and point value).
				The categories will include Binary Exploitation, Algorithms, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Web, and others.
				Some problems can be solved in a matter of minutes, while others may take hours or even days.
				The source code behind the website and problems will be released after the competition has ended.</p>

				<h2>Who can compete?</h2>
				<p>LASACTF will be open to any high school students around the world, but the only students within the United States will be eligible for prizes. Teams can be formed of up to five students provided they are all from the same school.</p>

				<h2>When?</h2>
				<p>12 PM US Central Time on March 19, to 12 PM US Central Time on March 26, 2016.

				<h2>Where?</h2>
				<p>The competition will be completely free, and run entirely online - the only materials teams will need are a working computer with internet access and the ability to run desktop applications.
				Competitors should register online to form a team - registration will be opened soon, and can be done at any point before or during the contest.</p>

				<h2>Why?</h2>
				<p>We enjoy programming and computer science, and CTF competitions (such as <a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a>, <a href="http://hsctf.com/">HSCTF</a>, <a href="http://easyctf.com/">EasyCTF</a>, and <a href="http://sctf.io/">sCTF</a>) were our first introduction to computer security.
				We want to help other high school students by running our own.</p>

				<h2>What constitutes cheating?</h2>
				<p>In general, use common-sense rules:
					Attacking or exploiting the server, other teams, or machines not explicitly designated as targets within the problems is considered cheating.
					This includes both breaking into such machines and denying others access to them (for example, by altering a key or ping-flooding).
					Sharing keys or providing overly-revealing hints to other teams is cheating, as is being directly assisted by personnel outside the team (using tools from the internet is OK; asking people on the internet to help you solve the problem is not).
					We encourage you to solve problems in novel and creative ways using all available resources, but we do require that you solve them yourselves.</p>

				<h2>Prizes?</h2>
				<p>There will be prizes! Information about what these will be will be released soon.</p>

				<h2>Who is running LASACTF?</h2>
				<p>LASACTF is being run by students at Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School of Austin (LASA), and by extension the Steam Locomotive CTF team.
				This includes Ehsan Asdar, Neil Patil, Michael Barre, Ashwin Gupta, Arthur Pachachura, and John Walton.</p>
